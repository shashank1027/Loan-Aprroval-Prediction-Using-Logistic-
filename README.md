# Loan-Aprroval-Prediction-Using-Logistic-
Predicting loan approval using logistic regression. This project includes EDA, data preprocessing, and model training using scikit-learn. Visualized key insights and evaluated model accuracy on real-world banking data.
# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant data such as credit score, income, number of dependents, loan amount, and more.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Loan approval dataset (used via Kaggle)
- Contains features such as:
  - CIBIL Score
  - Number of Dependents
  - Loan Amount
  - Loan Term
  - Income
  - Employment status
  - Credit History
  - and more

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Explored relationships between loan status and features using barplots
- Performed correlation analysis to identify key predictors

## 🧠 Model

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Library**: `scikit-learn`
- **Steps**:
  - Train-test split
  - Feature preprocessing
  - Model training and prediction
  - Evaluation using metrics like accuracy

## 📈 Performance

- Accuracy: ~ (insert your actual result)
- Observed rejection even for high CIBIL score → explored combinations for further insight
